# contigarray
## A library to allocate arbitrary data type multidimensional arrays (arbitrary shape) in C, where data is contiguous.

I made this code to support some other work I hope to start with matrices and tensors. As well as basic data types, this code should also work with structures, but I've not yet tested this.

This has been tested on a Linux machine using the gcc compiler against C99.
